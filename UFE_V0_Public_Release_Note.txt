This document is placed last by design — so that understanding precedes announcement.

Version 0 of the Universal Flourishing Blueprint marks the first complete iteration of the Universal Flourishing Ecosystem (UFE) — an open, living framework created to align reason, autonomy, and compassion through measurable systems of human flourishing.

This archive includes the Manifesto, Executive Deck, Visual Frameworks, and Curation Guide — designed for preservation, collaboration, and future refinement.

It exists thanks to the giants of knowledge and technology that carried us here, and to every mind that continues to question, build, and care.

If you’ve reached this note, you’ve completed the first cycle. The Blueprint now belongs to you too.
