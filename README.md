# Universal Flourishing Ecosystem (UFE)

**Version:** 0 (Living Document)

**Designing Human Flourishing** – The Universal Flourishing Ecosystem (UFE) is a living framework for designing human and systemic flourishing. It unites design thinking, measurement, and community to help individuals, organizations, and societies align reasoning, autonomy and decentralization.

## What is the UFE?

The UFE is an open meta-framework comprised of three interlocking parts:

1. **Universal Flourishing Blueprint (UFB)** – A structural framework for building flourishing systems. The UFB defines six stages – from discovery & assessment through prototyping and proof to system installation, scale, and federated replication – and uses ISO-inspired process discipline (Plan–Do–Check–Act) and core principles (reason, autonomy, decentralization) to guide progress.

2. **Human Flourishing Formula (HFF)** – A data-driven measurement layer that defines the metrics of flourishing. The HFF uses anonymized, aggregated data from participating organizations and communities to identify patterns and improve decision-making, enabling continuous learning.

3. **Global Federation of Practitioners** – The distributed network of individuals, groups, and institutions who apply and refine the Blueprint. Federation members commit to transparency, ethical collaboration, and open sharing of learnings.

These three gears (design, data, community) interlock around a central axis of truth, aligning individual flourishing with collective progress.

## Repository Contents

This repository holds the materials for **Version 0** of the UFE:

- **Universal_Flourishing_Blueprint_Manifesto.pdf** – The philosophical and structural foundation.
- **Universal_Flourishing_Blueprint_Executive_Deck.pdf** – A concise visual synthesis for presentations.
- **UFE_Gears_of_Flourishing.png** – A schematic of the ecosystem’s three gears.
- **UFE_Gears_of_Flourishing_Loop.mp4** – A short looped animation of the gears in motion.
- **UFE_Curation_Guide_V0.pdf** and `.txt` – Guidance for custodians on preserving and updating this living archive.
- **Metadata_UFB_V0.txt** – Embedded metadata for citation and archival.
- **README.md** – This file.
- **_Internal_Notes_For_V1_Preparation.txt** – Private instructions for curators preparing Version 1.
- **UFE_V0_Public_Release_Note.txt** – A concluding note to accompany public distribution.

Each file is part of an integrated ecosystem; together they form an operable and teachable system.

## Using the Blueprint

The UFB is designed to be adapted and applied across domains. To use it:

1. **Read the Manifesto** to understand the philosophy and structure.
2. **Review the Executive Deck** for a succinct overview of the stages.
3. **Apply Stage 0** (Discovery and Assessment) by completing the Stage 0 templates (not included in this repository; see Finessed Foundation resources).
4. **Move through Stages 1–5** sequentially:
   - Stage 1 (Idea → Prototype) – Test your core value hypothesis in a small experiment.
   - Stage 2 (Proof & Economics) – Validate repeatability and viability with unit economics.
   - Stage 3 (System Installation) – Install ISO-like process governance and dashboards.
   - Stage 4 (Scale & Institutionalization) – Build resilience, leadership, and compliance.
   - Stage 5 (Federated Replication & Legacy) – Share your learnings and support others.

At each stage, measure your progress using the HFF and contribute your insights back to the Federation.

## Contributing
