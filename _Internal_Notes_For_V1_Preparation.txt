Internal Notes — Preparing Version 1 (for Founder’s Reference Only)

1. Principle of Continuity
- Version 0 is immutable. Never alter or overwrite any file in the V0 archive.
- Every new release must begin as a clone of the previous folder, with its version number incremented.
- Keep V0 exactly as it stands; it is the philosophical baseline.

2. Folder & Naming Protocol
Each iteration uses this structure:
UFB_VX_YYYY_The_Finessed_Foundation/
Example: UFB_V1_2026_The_Finessed_Foundation/
Within each version folder:
- Retain Manifesto, Executive_Deck, Visuals, README, and Curation Guide.
- Add new or updated materials as numbered modules (e.g., Module_01_NewResearch.pdf).
- Include a file Changelog_V1.txt summarizing additions or revisions.

3. Version Metadata Updates
Update the embedded metadata fields for Version 1:
- Version: 1.0 (Validated Field Edition)
- Date: Year of release
- Contributors: Names of new authors or collaborators
- Description: Brief 2-sentence note describing the evolution (e.g., “Integrates field data from early adopters; adds HFF pilot metrics.”)
- Parent Framework: Universal Flourishing Ecosystem (UFE) — remains unchanged

4. Files to Preserve Unchanged
File           | Status   | Reason
Manifesto.pdf   | Immutable | Foundational philosophy
UFE_Gears_of_Flourishing.png | Immutable | Symbolic constant
UFE_Gears_of_Flourishing_Loop.mp4 | Immutable | Visual emblem
README.txt      | Update only “Version” and “Contents” sections | Maintain evolution log
UFE_Curation_Guide_V0.txt/pdf | Copy as V1 edition if policies evolve | Continuity of stewardship

5. Human Flourishing Formula Integration (HFF)
Beginning in V1, create a /Data subfolder for empirical collaborations:
Data/
├── HFF_Datasets/
├── Indicators_Metadata.txt
└── Insights_Summaries.pdf
- Only anonymized and aggregated data permitted.
- Document every source with date and institutional origin.
- Reference data contributors in the Manifesto appendix as Participating Nodes of the Federation.

6. Review and Publication Cycle
1. Draft (V1.x-beta): open feedback from partners.
2. Peer Review: at least one academic or ethical review per cycle.
3. Release (V1.0): formalized update; publish through Foundation channels.
4. Public Announcement: append new Release Note (placed last).

7. Ethical Anchor
Every update must preserve humility.
The Blueprint may expand in data and scope, but never in self-importance.

8. Closing Note for Custodians
If you ever doubt whether a change should be made — ask:
Does it increase clarity, transparency, or compassion?
If the answer is yes, proceed.
If not, leave it untouched.
